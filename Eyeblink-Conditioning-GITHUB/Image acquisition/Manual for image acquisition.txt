Use "Delay" for delay conditioning and "Trace" for trace conditioning.

Instructions for two manuscripts are the same.

For MATLAB R2021a users:

1. Click "APPS" tab on top and click "Image Acquisition".

2. Find your camera on Hardware Brower on the left side of the window. Click "MONO 8 (default)". If you cannot find your camera, refresh the list and check if you have installed the supporting package for your camera.

3. Click "Start Preview", adjust your camera configurations, and save the configurations. Next time you can open the configurations by clicking "File"-"Open configuration".

4. Close "Image Acquisition Tool".

5. Create folders to save your videos. The format should be the same as the example video folder. Which is: Video-->Mouse name-->Date of the experiment(For us is A1-A12 for acquisition, E1-E3 for extinction, RA1-RA4 for reacquisition, and R1-R2 for retension.).

6. Make sure the "Current Folder" on the left of the MATLAB window shows the folder you want your videos to be saved.

7. Run the manuscript.

8. Click "Start Preview", check the eye position.

9. Close the preview, adjust ROI using h_Main.h_Video.ROIPosition on line 23.

10. Run the manuscript again. Click "Start Preview". If the eye position looks ok, type "Exp" in the window and click "Stim. Protocol".

11. You will see a window pops out saying "Protocol finished" when it is done.

12. Move on to "Image Processing" folder to process the videos.
