The example videos have been processed and the data are stored in the "Data" folder.



For batch processing videos you have collected, use "funBatchvideo_Adopted".

1. Change the projDirectory(line 5) of "funBatchvideo_Adopted" to where the videos are located.

2. Change the projDirectory(line 2) of "funPlotProcess_Adopted" to the same address as step 1.

2. Run the manuscript.

3. You should see the data flies formated as V_yourvideoname showing in the "Data" folder when finished.



The videos for extinction experiments should be processed by a different manuscript called "funPlotProcessFlashOnly_Adopted".

1. Change the projDirectory(line 5) of "funPlotProcessFlashOnly_Adopted" to where the videos are located.

2. Change the BaseDirectory(line 19) to a videos you want to use as a baseline. For us it is "A12".

3. Run the manuscript.

4. You should see the data flies formated as V_yourvideoname showing in the "Data" folder when finished.



To generate a figure about the eyeclosure fration of a certaion day, use "funPlotProcess".

1. Change the projDirectory(line 5) of "funBatchvideo_Adopted" to where the videos are located.

2. Change the videoDirectory(line7) to the file address contain videos your choice. 

3. Run the manuscript.

4. The figure should pops up.
