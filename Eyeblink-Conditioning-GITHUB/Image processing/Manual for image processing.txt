The example videos have been processed and the data are stored in the "Data" folder.


***The folder directory need to be the same as the example otherwith the manuscrips will not run properly***


For batch processing videos you have collected, use "funBatchvideo_Adopted".

1. Change the projDirectory(line 5) of "funBatchvideo_Adopted" to where the videos are located.

2. Change the projDirectory(line 2) of "funPlotProcess_Adopted" to the same address as step 1.

3. Run the manuscript.

4. You should see the data flies formated as V_yourvideoname showing in the "Data" folder when finished.



The videos for extinction experiments should be processed by a different manuscript called "funPlotProcessFlashOnly_Adopted".

1. If you processed all the videos using "funBatchvideo_Adopted", delete all the extinction data generated by that.

2. Change the projDirectory(line 5) of "funPlotProcessFlashOnly_Adopted" to where the videos are located.

3. Change the BaseDirectory(line 19) to a videos you want to use as a baseline. For us it is "A12".

4. Run the manuscript.

5. You should see the data flies formated as V_yourvideoname showing in the "Data" folder when finished.



To generate a figure about the eyeclosure fration of a certaion day, use "funPlotProcess".

1. Change the projDirectory(line 5) of "funBatchvideo_Adopted" to where the videos are located.

2. Change the videoDirectory(line7) to the file address contain videos your choice. 

3. Run the manuscript.

4. The figure should pops up.
