The example videos have been analysed and the analysis data are save in "Data" file as "A_videonames".

To get the learning percentage and the CR amplitude:

1. Open "funLearningAbility_v03_Adopted".

2. Change the projDirectory(line 5) to where the Eyeblink-Conditioning-GITHUB folder has been saved.

3. Change the videoDirectory(line 6) to the directory of your video.

4. Run the manuscript.

5. Two Figure will pop up. One shows the learning percentage and the other shows the CR amplitude.

6. The CR amplitude are saved in "A_yourvideo" file in the "Data" folder. Open it in the MATLAB Workforce to see the number.  

*The CR amplitude are calculated using data without US. However, most example videos were taken in experiments with US. So the CR amplitude for the example videos are not accurate.


To get the waterfall figure:

1. Open "WaterfallProcess03_Adopted".

2. Select videos and put in a folder. For DEMO, put all the example videos into one folder.

3. Change the projDirectory(line 10) to where the Eyeblink-Conditioning-GITHUB folder has been saved.

4. Change the videoDirectory(line 12) to where your videos have been saved.

5. Run the manuscript.
